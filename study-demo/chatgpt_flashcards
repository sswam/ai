Prompt: the prompt
Answer: the answer
PromptImage: a search query that should return relevant images for the prompt; include this only if the flashcard needs an image on the prompt side
AnswerImage: a search query that should return relevant images for the answer; include this only if the flashcard needs an image on the answer side

Preferably make the notes suitable for reversible flashcards, i.e. they should still make sense if prompt and answer are swapped, so don't include the main words from the prompt in the answer.

Only give the requested output."
