    "In this post, I described my journey of setting up a development environment for deep learning on Debian, and the challenges I faced while doing so. I went through various steps, such as setting up apt sources, installing required packages (including Python, NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT), installing Rust, and setting up Python virtual environments. I also described how to building Xformers from source. I hope the post can be useful for anyone looking to set up a development environment for deep learning on Debian, in particular I expect it might be useful as a reference for myself in future."
