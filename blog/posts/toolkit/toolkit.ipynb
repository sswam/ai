    "In recent weeks there has been rapid progress in AI, with the widespread availability of powerful Large Language Models such as OpenAI GPT3.5 and GPT4. We have also seen the release of LLMs that we can run at home, such as LLaMA, Point Alpaca, fine-tuned Galactica, OpenAssistant Pythia, and Cerebras GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software development is being greatly accelerated by tools such a Github Copilot and OpenAI GPT. Copilot is able to complete code as the programmer types, saving a huge amount of time. GPT4 is able to write whole programs to spec in a matter of minutes, with relatively few bugs. We are, I think, at the start of an AI renaissance. Now is the time to have fun and achieve great things, before they've all been done by someone else, and before the robots and AI's completely eclipse us!\n",

    "I am admittedly more expert at toolkit programming than I am at AI model training, however I think that there is a place for the software-tools programmer in modern AI, and I intend to demonstrate that in this blog post."

    "Two very expressive programming languages are the shell, and make. Most people don't use the shell for programming, and even fewer use make to execute programs. Those people might be missing out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell enables to create pipelines of processes, which can solve problems much more concisely and in a modular fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make enables to set up relations between objects, then try to build any requested object. This is particularly good for exploratory programming or for systems that might be flaky, as we can correct a part of the program than re-run just the steps that remain rather than starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the shell and make are held back by fairly crufty and obscure syntax, but we can handle that. If a program seems better suited to Python, C, or some other language, we can use that language.\n",

    "Here are two main ideas from the software toolbox approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The Unix philosophy* is documented by Doug McIlroy in the Bell System Technical Journal from 1978:\n",
    "    - Make each program do one thing well.\n",
    "    - To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new \"features\".\n",
    "    - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.\n",
    "2. *The Practice of Programming*, as described by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike:\n",
    "    - Simplicity, which keeps programs short and manageable;\n",
    "    - clarity, which makes sure they are easy to understand, for people as well as machines;\n",
    "    - generality, which means they work well in a broad range of situations and adapt well as new situations arise; and\n",
    "    - automation, which lets the machine do the work for us, freeing us from mundane tasks."
