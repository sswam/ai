I'm Sam Watkins, from Melbourne, Australia.

I am starting this blog to record my AI studies, particularly with the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) book and courses.

It's important for me to record what I'm learning. If I publish these notes as a blog, I can get feedback and possibly help other people too.
