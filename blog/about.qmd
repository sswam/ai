I'm Sam Watkins, an AI enthusiast based in Melbourne, Australia. I come from a background in computer science and I am interested in helping people to learn using technology. I believe AI has the potential to make a positive impact on society if it doesn't annihilate us all by accident.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my notes and insights from studying the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) book and courses. My goal is to document my learning journey and provide a resource for others who are interested in learning about AI. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll likely be horrified, confused or overwhelmed if you read any of my blog posts!  But maybe you'll find something useful here.

I'm active on various social networks, so feel free to connect with me on any of these platforms.
