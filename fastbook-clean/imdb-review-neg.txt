This left me speechless......and not in a breath-taking "Shawshank Redemption" type way!
I literally wanted to rip my arm off and throw it at the TV it was so bad.
My husband and I made a bet with one another as to who could keep watching it the longest........the loser buying the weekend beers!
I was quite happy to lose that night.
I had no idea what was going on, it kept skipping from one sketch to another with no plot, no reason and NO POINT!
Awful acting, awful impressions, awful film! Pretty much is what it says on the tin, A Disaster.
Do not watch this movie.
You'd be better off stapling your genitals to a table for an hour...it'll be less painful for you!
